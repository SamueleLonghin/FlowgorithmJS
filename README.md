# FlowgorithmJS
[Flowgorithm (http://www.flowgorithm.org)](http://www.flowgorithm.org) is an excellent software for drawing flowcharts. The files generated by Flowgorithm (with the extension .fprg) are in an open XML format.

**FlowgorithmJS** is a third-party tool written in Javascript that can read and display one or more .fprg files on a web page.
_The software is under development. The first beta version will be published soon._
